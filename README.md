# Description
This project was a semester long process of creating a website that serves as a personal biography/about me. Prior to this class, I had little to no HTML/CSS knowledge and this class taught me how to build a website from scratch. I learned how to implement HTML, CSS, work with GitHub and Netlify as well as VSCode. In learning HTML/CSS, this semester covered adding images, links, styling, responsive design, web forms, embedded media, and a navigation bar. These are key features to most modern websites and learning them allowed me to understand how to create the fundamentals of a website.


## Navigation Bar
We learned how to make a hamburger menu navigation bar in mobile and have it integrate into the header on desktop.

This serves to smoothly traverse to sections of the code such as bio, gallery, blog, and contact me informatoin.

## Biography

We learned how to create a biography section that allows one to express oneself and their life.


## Hobbies

We learned how to create a list of hobbies that we partake in and then filled them out in depth.


## Gallery

We learned how to create a table of images that shifts with media sizes. These images pertained to our hobbies and interests.
 

## Video

We learned how to embed a Youtube video into our website. 

## Blog

We learned how to create an article portion for our website where we filled in information about a certain CSS design that we chose.

## Footer

We created a footer with our name and copyright information.

I decided to use a purple and dark color contrast. I found that this design is becoming more popular as a result of dark mode. I think it looks soothing on the eyes and it passes contrast ratio tests.

The respective hex codes were:

#2E2E2E

#1f1f1f

#38004F

#800080

#FFFFFF
