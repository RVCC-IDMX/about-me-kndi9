# Description
This project was a semester long process of creating a website that serves as a personal biography/about me. Prior to this class, I had little to no HTML/CSS knowledge and this class taught me how to build a website from scratch. I learned how to implement HTML, CSS, work with GitHub and Netlify as well as VSCode. In learning HTML/CSS, this semester covered adding images, links, styling, responsive design, web forms, embedded media, and a navigation bar. These are key features to most modern websites and learning them allowed me to understand how to create the fundamentals of a website.

I decided to use a purple and dark color contrast. I found that this design is becoming more popular as a result of dark mode. I think it looks soothing on the eyes and it passes contrast ratio tests.

The respective hex codes were:
#2E2E2E
#1f1f1f
#38004F
#800080
#FFFFFF
