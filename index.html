            <h2>Excerpt from Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</h2>

            <div>
                <p>"My will? Yes, certainly, I know that," said the doctor, a trifle sharply. "You have told me so."</p>

                <p>"Well, I tell you so again," continued the lawyer. "I have been learning something of young Hyde."
                </p>

                <p>The large handsome face of Dr. Jekyll grew pale to the very lips, and there came a blackness about
                    his eyes. "I do
                    not care to hear more," said he. "This is a matter I thought we had agreed to drop."</p>

                <p>"What I heard was abominable," said Utterson.</p>

                <p>"It can make no change. You do not understand my position," returned the doctor, with a certain
                    incoherency of
                    manner. "I am painfully situated, Utterson; my position is a very strange--a very strange one. It is
                    one of those
                    affairs that cannot be mended by talking."</p>

                <p>"Jekyll," said Utterson, "you know me: I am a man to be trusted. Make a clean breast of this in
                    confidence; and I
                    make no doubt I can get you out of it."</p>

                <p>"My good Utterson," said the doctor, "this is very good of you, this is downright good of you, and I
                    cannot find
                    words to thank you in. I believe you fully; I would trust you before any man alive, ay, before
                    myself, if I could
                    make the choice; but indeed it isn’t what you fancy; it is not as bad as that; and just to put your
                    good heart at
                    rest, I will tell you one thing: the moment I choose, I can be rid of Mr. Hyde. I give you my hand
                    upon that; and I
                    thank you again and again; and I will just add one little word, Utterson, that I’m sure you’ll take
                    in good part:
                    this is a private matter, and I beg of you to let it sleep."</p>

                <p>Utterson reflected a little, looking in the fire.</p>

                <p>"I have no doubt you are perfectly right," he said at last, getting to his feet.</p>

                <p>"Well, but since we have touched upon this business, and for the last time I hope," continued the
                    doctor, "there is
                    one point I should like you to understand. I have really a very great interest in poor Hyde. I know
                    you have seen
                    him; he told me so; and I fear he was rude. But I do sincerely take a great, a very great interest
                    in that young
                    man; and if I am taken away, Utterson, I wish you to promise me that you will bear with him and get
                    his rights for
                    him. I think you would, if you knew all; and it would be a weight off my mind if you would promise."
                </p>

                <p>"I can’t pretend that I shall ever like him," said the lawyer.</p>

                <p>"I don’t ask that," pleaded Jekyll, laying his hand upon the other’s arm; "I only ask for justice; I
                    only ask you to
                    help him for my sake, when I am no longer here."</p>
