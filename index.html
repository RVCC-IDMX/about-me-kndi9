            <div>
                <p>
                    I am an IT student who is planning on majoring in cybersecurity. I am planning on transfering to
                    Rutgers next fall for my bachelors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I like to learn about web development as it is interesting to see what one can do with HTML and CSS.
                    I was learning Java and Python in supplement to this class this semester. I think that helped me
                    understand some of the aspects of HTML and CSS more, and
                    also made it less overwhelming.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I found this class to be entertaining as it allowed me to design my own website for myself.
                    figure things out by myself.
                </p>
                <p>Web development is definitely a useful tool to have in your arsenal! I'm glad that I came out this
                    course with an expanded skillset.</p>

            <h2>Scalable Vector Graphics</h2>

            <div>
                <p>Scalable Vector Graphics are an XML based markup language that is used in describing two dimensional
                    based vector graphics.
                    This is a text-based, open WEb standard that can be used for describing that are rendered cleanly at
                    any size and are designed to work well
                    with CSS, JavaScript, DOM, and SMIL. SVG is to graphics, what HTML is to text.
                </p>

                <p>The history of the SVG file goes all the way to back to the late 1990s when the World Wide Web
                    Consortium(W3C) decided to invite proposals from developers
                    in order to create a new type of vector graphic format. There were six competing proposals that were
                    submitted and eventually became the W3C's SVG format.
                    Until roughly 2017, SVG began to grow in popularity as developers began to notice the benefits of
                    using SVGs in modern web browseres. Nowadays, SVG files are
                    used for 2D website images as most browsers have vector files that handle them with ease.
                </p>

                <p>I decided to chose SVGs to learn about because they can be used for website icons, logos,
                    infographics, and illustrations. I often am interested in graphical
                    design and this led to me picking SVGs. Designers can use SVGs to display icons like buttons, logos,
                    and easily scape them up or down without comprising
                    the quality. This is ideal, and I actually used SVGs for my buttons in the hamburger menu.

                    On top of this, the XML use within SVG files allows easy readablity
                    for search engines such as Google. Google can detect keywords within the SVGs which helps with
                    search engine optimization.

                <p>There are advantages and disadvantages to using SVG. SVG is not made up of pixels and therefore the
                    vector graphics always maintain their resolution. No matter
                    how large or small the SVG is made, one does not have to worry about losing image quality. SVG files
                    are often smaller than raster images as well. Due to the nature
                    of SVG files treating text as text, a screen reader can scan any words in SVG images. This is useful
                    for people who are disabled and need reader accessibility for the web page.
                    The disadvantges of SVG files are that they struggle to display high quality digital photos. If one
                    wanted to showcase their portfolio, they would be better off using JPEG or
                    PNG files instead of SVG files. Modern browsers as well are only capable of using SVG images, but
                    this is becoming less of a problem as companies do catch up. Lastly, SVG
                    can be hard to understand at first. I know I was confused at first when I looked at the SVG for
                    making the hamburger icon!
                </p>

                <p>
                    I was particularly interested in the animation capabilities for SVG. SVG graphics can be animated
                    through animation elements which can be useful in designing
                    a website with animated logos or design. I saw some basic smooth animations, like a square turning
                    into a circle, and more intricate designs that required
                    some graphical work to integrate.
                </p>
